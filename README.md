# (Free) Monads for Kotlin

This is a small Kotlin library to simplify implementing monadic DSLs
in Kotlin, through the use of `suspend` functions and the compiler's
CPS transformation.

It is described at length in a JavaSPEKTRUM 2023 article *Monaden in
Kotlin* by Michael Sperber and Benedikt Stemmildt.

The code is [here](src/main/kotlin/de/activegroup/MonadDSL.kt), and
includes documentation.

Examples are [here](test/kotlin/de/activegroup).
